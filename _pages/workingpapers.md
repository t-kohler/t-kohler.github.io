[*Do Non-Compete Clauses Undermine Minimum Wages?*](http://t-kohler.github.io/files/Kohler,Schmitz_NCC.pdf)
(with Fabian Schmitz)

  <summary>Abstract</summary>

Many low-wage workers in the United States are subject to non-compete clauses.
After the termination of their employments, they are not allowed to work for competitors.
Empirical research has found a link between the prevalence of non-compete clauses and minimum wage legislation. 
To explain this link, we propose a moral hazard model with minimum wages.
Non-compete clauses can be used to punish failure.
We characterize the optimal contracts with and without the possibility to use a non-compete clause. 
We find that the principal only uses a non-compete clause if minimum wages are sufficiently high. 
We show that with non-compete clauses the principal induces an effort level that first decreases in the minimum wage and then increases when the principal starts to use a non-compete clause. 
If non-compete clauses can be arbitrarily sever, eventually, the principal induces an effort level that exceeds the first-best effort level. 
If non-compete clauses are bounded, both the principal and the agent might be made better off than without non-compete clauses.
